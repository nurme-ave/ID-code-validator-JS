## Overview

### Project Description

The Estonian identification (ID) code is a unique 11-digit code and it has a set of requirements. This program checks all these requirements step by step (I have written different functions for each step) and makes sure that the ID-code is indeed valid.

Originally I wrote this project in Python but I thought it would be a great learning experience to re-write this in JavaScript as well.

I designed the page myself and there are different views for mobile and desktop which was a bit challenging but it was interesting to experiment with different ideas. I'm also using the color combination blue-black-white here intentionally as these are the colors of the national Estonian flag.

This project was a great way to practise how to split the code into several smaller functions and then stitch everything together in one function to render the code.

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.
